decompile the apk using jadx
we have 4 png and 4 mp3 files
one of the file 3.mp3 is in morser code 
using https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html if we decode the audio we get BV1OUS
second image contains a qr. seeing the source code gives
something like USTCtf{not so ******* blahblah}
putting 0 to BV1OUS we get 0BV1OUS
we add  0BV1OUS to the flag
