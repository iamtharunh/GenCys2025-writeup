we have 30mins and 2mins video
video 1 says its AES256 encrypted 
Video 2 say nothin on surface
hint says audio is important
i listened to i can hear dialpad, i did dtmf and found a huge text
strings on video2  last line gave a key
i saw in a writeup we need to remove #
chatgpt said its cbc and IV is 0000........
it gave this code  
from base64 import b64decode
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad

nums = "107#71#66#73#116#73#70#69#116#120#72#66#102#79#86#88#81#104#51#68#77#84#97#73#57#89#86#74#115#112#102#109#110#99#110#106#111#48#121#97#43#90#69#108#71#122#100#117#80#111#76#122#72#99#121#111#90#115#102#51#99#66#57#80"
key_str = "23872947523978598732495873289321"

# Decode numbers -> ASCII -> Base64
raw_ascii = bytes(int(x) for x in nums.split('#'))
ct = b64decode(raw_ascii.decode())

key = key_str.encode()  # 32 bytes for AES-256
iv = b'\x00' * 16      # zero IV

flag = unpad(AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv).decrypt(ct), 16)
print(flag.decode())

i got this flag USTCtf{445eb8b348dbaef887011882b56df69e}
